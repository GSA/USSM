The governmentwide governance and operating model drives collaboration and change management with stakeholders across the federal government to identify solutions that deliver the best value to taxpayers and support efficient government.

**The Shared Services Policy Officer**

The Shared Services Policy Officer (SSPO) is designated by the OMB Director and has the responsibility and authority, in conjunction with OMB offices, to lead the development and implementation of mission support shared services policy across the government.  They also co-chair the Shared Solutions Governance Board (SSGB). Suzette Kent, the Federal Chief Information Officer at the Office of Management and Budget, is currently serving as the SSPO.

**[Shared Solutions Governance Board](../ssgb)**

The Shared Solutions Governance Board (SSGB) is a cross functional steering committee co-chaired by GSA and a co-chair selected by the voting membership that will rotate annually. The SSGB is comprised of representatives from the CXO councils and is responsible for making recommendations to OMB on potential sharing opportunities and for advising on the implementation of the designated activities.  The SSGB will also serve as the escalation point for the Business Standards Council (BSC) to resolve inconsistencies in the creation of business and data standards or to suggest possible resolutions for OMB policy officials.

**Business Standards Council**

The Business Standards Council (BSC) is the cross-government working group comprised of OMB-designated functional leads that will work together to design an integrated, end-to-end future state of mission support activities, in collaboration with each CXO Council and the authoritative governance bodies over business processes or standards. The standards will follow the [Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF)](../fibf) to identify a common set of capabilities for designated mission-support functions.
