Modernization and Migration Management (M3) Framework
I-2
The Modernization and Migration (M3) Framework is the roadmap for agencies “buying a service” - delivering projects on time, on budget, and on value. The M3 framework is designed to help Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies achieve successful outcomes and reduce risk during administrative system and/or service modernizations and migrations.

The M3 Framework is a six-phased approach to system and service modernizations and migrations including objectives, key activities and outcomes for each phase. Within each phase, there are associated activities grouped across four workstreams: (1) Program Management,	(2) Workforce, Organization and Stakeholders, (3) Technology, (4) Process and Service Delivery 

The M3 Framework is aligned with the Investment Planning Process – CFO Act agencies may be required to conduct mandatory formal reviews. These reviews are designed to: 1) Evaluate migration risk and make recommendations to customer and provider organizations to mitigate potential hurdles to success, and 2) Assess outcomes at each phase and make recommendations to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on budgeting for modernization and migration investments.

What is the M3 Playbook? The M3 Playbook was developed to help customer and provider organizations apply the M3 Framework. The M3 Playbook is not prescriptive, but provides guidance, tools, and templates, based on best practices, to help CFO Act agency customers and providers improve the likelihood of successful outcomes of their modernization and migration projects. Customers and providers are encouraged to leverage their own tools and templates to satisfy the expected outcomes.The Playbook consists of guidance and tools to help agencies plan for and navigate transitions. It was developed based on feedback from over 100 Government and industry experts, reflects best practices and lessons learned from prior migrations and is updated annually.60+ Activities: Descriptions for how to apply the M3 framework, including detailed activity steps, inputs, outputs, lessons learned, and stakeholders involved.25+ Templates: Template documents that include comprehensive guidance that aid customers and providers in the completion of activities and provide key considerations.Examples: An OMB Max page that includes sample documentation from previous modernization and migration projects.M3 Document and Example Tracker: Outlines the initial creation and updates of M3 Documents as outlined throughout all Phases for easy-to-follow tracking and maintenance. It also includes a list of current M3 Examples as stored on Max.gov.

Who are the Responsible Parties? Customers are agency program/project managers or representatives that will use the M3 Playbook to develop an understanding of how to approach shared services modernization.

QSMOs (Quality Service Management Offices) are OMB designated federal agencies serving as governmentwide storefronts and brokers, offering multiple solutions for technology and services in their functional area. They offer modern technology and transaction processing solutions to drive scale, standardization, and efficiency. Housed in federal agencies with the mission and expertise to deliver standard capabilities for other agencies, QSMOs are trusted advisors that:

Offer and manage a marketplace of solutions for common technology, services, or fully managed services to respond to agency needs;
Guide and govern the long-term sustainability of the services and solutions marketplace;
Institute a customer engagement and feedback model that allows for continuous improvement and performance management of solutions; and
Drive the implementation to standards established through the collaborative governance process that produce efficiencies in process and scale.

Providers offer customers with access to technology and services within their designated functional area, and use the M3 Playbook to assist customer agencies in their shared services modernization journeys. There are two types of Shared Services Providers (SSP’s), Federal Shared Services Providers (FSSPs) and Commercial Shared Services Providers (CSSPs). 

Shared indicates a shared responsibility between customers and providers.

Who is OSSPI?
The Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) coordinates government-wide shared services governance, executes program management, and develops processes to support development and implementation of OMB policy as it relates to mission support services. For the M3 Playbook, OSSPI coordinates and organizes between customers, QSMOs, and providers potentially escalating questions, concerns, and useful information as needed.

Project Business Case
Best Practice
Set defined performance and success metrics (including a combination of compliance, process, and workload measures to define baselines and target metrics) at the beginning of the program to be able to measure and communicate the benefits intended, and ultimately achieved, by the program
Benchmark Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against internal and external standards and use existing performance metric data to assist in identifying performance targets (e.g. previous Federal Benchmarking results, Shared Services Customer Satisfaction Surveys, etc.). Consider contacting ussm.m3@gsa.gov for assistance researching agency specific and government-wide results
In most cases greater efficiencies are achieved, but short-term cost reductions are not. With the introduction of greater amounts of IT support however, substantial savings are realized in the longer term

A Change Readiness Assessment involves the periodic assessment of how stakeholders are responding or engaging with the change. Note this is not a one-time assessment. If an organization’s leadership and management are driving the change in a modeled way, then they should see changes in readiness scores as the change process approaches
Industry standards and change management best practices provide multiple change models that can be harnessed based on preference or organizational needs (e.g., Prosci, Prosci’s ADKAR Change Model, Kotter, Lewin’s Change Model) 
Change management’s end goal is shifting the organization from a state of resistance to acceptance. Utilize the Change Curve to better understand the stages of individual transition and organizational change. Top level leadership commitment and active support for the change effort drives the most impact when implementing any change
