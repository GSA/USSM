I"ÿ	<p>The Federal Government pays over two million civilian federal employees every two-weeks, on time and at a relatively low cost. Some of the payroll systems running today, however, are in their fourth decade of operation and lack the ability to adapt and address the ever evolving legislative changes. They also lack self-service and mobile features readily available in industry payroll systems. Making these self-service and mobile features available to the federal employee will improve efficiency and customer service.</p>

<p>Currently, four independent systems, without common data or interoperability standards, manage payroll for the executive branch of the Federal Government. This means transferring employees between agencies and providers requiries manual processes and hard-copy forms, which translates to labor hours and tax dollars. It also means we are missing out on critical data that could be used to better manage the federal workforce as the government attempts to move to a more nimble and highly-skilled model.</p>

<p>On May 17th, the U.S. General Services Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Office of Shared Solutions and Program Improvement (OSSPI) issued a <a href="http://go.usa.gov/xQPCj">pre-solicitation notice</a> to secure solutions to modernize the federal governmentâ€™s current civilian payroll systems. This effort is in line with the key tenants of the Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda and specifically the Cross Agency Priority Goals for Sharing Quality Services and IT Modernization.</p>

<p>OSSPI, in partnership with Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) and the current shared services providers, is working to use governmentwide standards to shift operations and maintenance of payroll functions to innovative commercial solutions using the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.</p>

<p>MAESC/CIOC/CFOC members and their staff contributed to the <a href="https://www.ussm.gov/fibf/">standards</a> and acquisition strategy and will continue to play a key role in this transformation.</p>

<p>This will enable agencies to focus human and fiscal resources on core mission priorities and deploy modern, secure work schedule leave management and payroll solutions to support a modern workforce.  The initiative is referred to as NewPay. The pre-solicitation notice is available on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fbo.gov/notices/c3e559e7257212d2e481f9a2de476a20&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1527255962103000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFlZ5ZeUHu8VvXu0Bvzr3bc52lsQ">FedBizOpps</a> and will close on June 1, 2018.</p>
