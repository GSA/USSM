I"¿<p>Building on the creation of the USSM, OMB Memorandum 16-11 acknowledged that, although each Line of Business (LoB) operates in its own unique environment with specific requirements and challenges, all LoBs would benefit from closer coordination and collaboration supported by a more robust cross-functional governance model. To achieve this end, the LoBs, in coordination with USSM, have established the Business Standards Council (BSC) to ensure better coordination of the Shared Services initiative.</p>
