        <h2>Grants Quality Service Management Office (Grants QSMO) Marketplace</h2>
        <p>The Grants QSMO seeks to transform grants management by empowering and enabling federal awarding agencies, applicants, and recipients with modern tools to efficiently and effectively deliver on the federal grants mission. The Marketplace is an online catalog of Grants QSMO-validated federal shared solutions/services that provide high quality, innovative, and trusted services.  The Marketplace covers functions and activities across the grants management lifecycle, as aligned to the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fibf-gm/">Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) for Grants Management (GRM)</a>. The Marketplace also provides federal agency customers with detailed information about each solution/service to support and inform decisions regarding adoption of shared solutions/services, as well as information regarding mandatory federal solutions/services utilized in the grants management lifecycle. The Grants QSMO will continue to expand and mature the Marketplace over time to provide solution/service offerings that address the varying needs of all federal awarding agency customers.</p>

    <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a-1" tabindex="0">How should federal awarding agencies use the Grants QSMO Marketplace?</button>
    <div id="a-1" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>This Grants QSMO Marketplace has been developed for use by all federal agencies that award grants and/or cooperative agreements.  The Marketplace has been aligned to the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fibf-gm/">Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) for grants management</a> and provides agencies with transparent information on validated shared solutions/services across the grants lifecycle to support and inform agency decisions related to adoption of shared solutions/services.</p>
      <p>Federal agencies that have identified a requirement for grants IT for any part of the grants lifecycle should consult this Marketplace, the Grants QSMO team, and the respective shared service providers to determine if Marketplace offerings can meet their grants IT requirements. In the event an agency cannot meet its grants IT requirements with a Marketplace offering, the agency is to coordinate with the Grants QSMO which will support and advise the agency on potential investments to develop, modernize, enhance, or procure a solution/service, as required by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf" target="_blank">OMB Memos M-19-16 - PDF</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/M_21_20.pdf" target="_blank">M-21-20 - PDF</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-12.pdf" target="_blank">M-22-12 – PDF</a>. This accompanying investment review process ensures that an agency investing in grants IT aligns the project to the Grants QSMO's Seven Guiding Principles for Grants Technology Modernization, leverages the Grants QSMO’s existing market research, shared resources, and best practices (e.g., GSA’s M3 Playbook), and avoids duplicative investments across the government. If you are a Federal Awarding Agency looking to invest in a grants IT system or have any questions for the Grants QSMO please contact us and visit our Grants QSMO Collaboration Site on <a href="https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HHS&title=Grants+Quality+Service+Management+Office" target="_blank">OMB MAX</a>.</p>

    <div id="a-2" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>For inclusion in this Marketplace, the Grants QSMO requires externally shared federal solutions/services across the grants lifecycle to complete its 3-step Marketplace Validation Process (MVP) for their current functionality and offerings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1: Solution/service owners complete the Grants QSMO's Federal Shared Service Provider MVP Questionnaire, an in-depth list of standardized questions and associated validation criteria that drive toward a more transparent and detailed understanding of each offering. The MVP Questionnaire helps the Grants QSMO evaluate and ensure each solution/service offering aligns to the Grants QSMO's Seven Guiding Principles for Grants Technology Modernization:
          <ul>
              <li>Central focus on customer experience and improved mission delivery;</li>
              <li>Adoption of business and data standards;</li>
              <li>Adherence to security & technology standards;</li>
              <li>Making purposeful and strategic investments;</li>
              <li>Commitment to balancing innovation with stability of operations;</li>
              <li>Employment of agile development of interchangeable, interoperable solutions; and </li>
              <li>Use of data as a strategic asset.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2: Upon completion of the MVP Questionnaire, the Grants QSMO conducts a rigorous review of the submitted responses and supporting documentation, and then meets with each of the federal shared service providers to discuss their responses, provide recommendations, and further explore areas of significant interest and/or impact.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Following the Grants QSMO's evaluation and final review of the MVP Questionnaire responses, the Grants QSMO will formally onboard the validated solution/service to the Marketplace. Grants QSMO-validated solutions above are indicated with a green checkmark and the word "validated."</li>
        <li><i>Note: The detailed process described above is the first step towards creating a high-quality foundation for the Grants QSMO Marketplace. The MVP process and the Marketplace itself will continue to evolve as we develop and implement a Marketplace maturity framework, incorporate user feedback, and bring on additional shared solution/service offerings.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are interested in learning more about Marketplace Validation Process, and/or would like to provide suggestions or ideas to help shape the future of the Marketplace, please contact our team at <a href="mailto:GrantsQSMO@hhs.gov">GrantsQSMO@hhs.gov</a>.</p>

  <div class="usa-accordion">
    <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a-3" tabindex="0">How has the Grants QSMO explored available grants IT offerings or capabilities provided by the commercial sector?  Are you a commercial provider of a grants management IT solution/service that is interested in being part of the Grants QSMO Marketplace?</button>
    <div id="a-3" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>As a result of the Grants QSMO’s ongoing assessments of Federal awarding agencies' grants technology needs, the Grants QSMO released a <a href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_7WYqxF9n0KMyCR8">Request for Information (RFI)</a> in March 2022 to gain a better understanding of the commercial grants IT solution ecosystem, as well as learn from industry on how best to operationalize a commercial side of the Grants QSMO Marketplace in the future. A government-wide team of over 20 reviewers from across 10 federal agencies reviewed the RFI responses from 62 respondents and participated in a Market Research Week hosted by the Grants QSMO, during which one-on-one sessions were held with specified vendors with existing end-to-end solution offerings.</p>
      <p>The Grants QSMO has since partnered with a small federal awarding agency to leverage this market research and is currently piloting with them to develop an ordering guide and information hub.  By leveraging Grants QSMO market research (which includes vendor cost estimates, current capabilities, and RFI results), this type of partnership will support agencies in their initial acquisition planning efforts and streamline the acquisition process (saving hundreds of hours of market research). Looking ahead to FY23 and beyond, the Grants QSMO intends to operationalize and mature the Marketplace by assessing multiple approaches to offer and support the acquisition of commercial solutions/services on the Marketplace.  The Grants QSMO team expects to engage with commercial providers on future Marketplace solution needs later in FY23.</p>

    <div id="a-4" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>The Grants QSMO is developing a customer-focused Marketplace Maturity Framework to guide updates to the content, appearance, and user experience of the Marketplace.  The team will be working collaboratively with the Marketplace Shared Service Providers to determine a common way to share price methodologies as well as measure and display customer satisfaction data for their solutions/services.  The Grants QSMO will also expand the number of validated offerings on the Marketplace as additional externally shared federal Shared Service Providers complete the Marketplace Validation Process.  Looking ahead to FY23 and beyond, the Grants QSMO is also assessing multiple approaches to offer and support the acquisition of commercial solutions/services on the Marketplace.

    <div id="a-5" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>The Grants QSMO acknowledges the following Shared Principles as it carries out its designated responsibilities per <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf">OMB Memo M-19-16</a>:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The Grants QSMO will minimize any additional administrative and bureaucratic burden for all stakeholders, particularly for validated Marketplace solutions/services and providers;</li>
          <li>The Grants QSMO will partner with validated solutions/services and providers as they define the types of customers that are the best fit for their solution/service, to help enable the Grants QSMO to properly help validated solutions/services and providers manage customer expectations;</li>
          <li>The Grants QSMO and validated solutions/services and providers will collaborate to support implementation of grants management data standards, in alignment with any forthcoming determinations from OMB and the Grants Standard Setting Agency;</li>
          <li>The Grants QSMO and validated solutions/services and providers will continue to collaborate and share information via recurring 1:1 meetings, work group meetings with other validated solutions/services on the Grants QSMO Marketplace (e.g., via the Marketplace Partnership Work Group (MPWG)), and other forums, as appropriate;</li>
          <li>The Grants QSMO and validated solutions/services and providers will continue to collaborate and share information on planned investments in new modules or system functionality, as well as significant modernization efforts to enhance existing services; and</li>
          <li>The Grants QSMO will continue to collaborate with validated solutions/services and providers to strategize on how best to develop more common customer engagement and feedback models that can better enable continuous improvement and performance management, improve customer and user experience, and reduce burden for recipients and federal awarding agency partners.</li>
