An enduring challenge in the Federal IT ecosystem is testing potential new products with relevant “real-world” data prior to a costly acquisition action without infringing upon numerous security requirements, Privacy Act laws, regulations or policies. Programs have spent significant time and money  granting Authority to Operate (ATO) for non-production systems to test de-identified data with a prospective software vendor. A corollary challenge arises when proposing and/or testing interfaces between existing systems that cross Agency or Departmental boundaries.  

Thus, the transactional purpose of the Golden Data Test Set (GDTS) is to provide a set of realistic, non-PII, fictitious employee profiles and test scenarios to test human resource (HR), time and attendance, and payroll systems for pay calculation accuracy and alignment to pay-impacting standards as published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Human Resources Line-of-Business (HRLoB). The GDTS helps to:   
* Reduce risk by offering pre-acquisition test data,
* Save labor hours in testing,
* Alleviate security and privacy concerns in test data, and
* Foster a standards-compliant ecosystem that enhances interoperability, accuracy, and efficiency of integration.
