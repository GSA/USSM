bestPractice:
  - Begin data cleansing activities prior to migration activities and continuously throughout the implementation to assist with data readiness
  - Obtain agreement on data governance including metadata management and data quality management
  - Allocate a sufficient number of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with the appropriate skill sets to support data conversion activities throughout the implementation
  - Establish criteria and metrics to clearly convey what constitutes “clean” data as part of the broader data governance approach
