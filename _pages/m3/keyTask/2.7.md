bestPractice:
  - Start data cleansing before implementation and iterate continuously, as needed, to ensure readiness
  - Obtain agreement on data governance including metadata management and data quality management
  - Allocate sufficient number of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with appropriate skills to support data conversion
  - Establish criteria / metrics to clearly convey what constitutes “clean” data in the broader data governance approach
