bestPractice:
  - It is critical to success to begin data cleansing activities well before migration activities begin and continuously throughout the implementation to assist with data readiness
  - Define and establish the framework for the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data in the Data Governance Model
  - Assign dedicated resources for data cleansing activities to ensure successful migration
  - Gain agreement on data governance including metadata management and data quality management
  - Allocate a sufficient number of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with the appropriate skill sets to support data conversion activities throughout the implementation
  - Establish criteria and metrics through the Data Governance Model on what threshold constitutes “clean” data. Outline the course of actions to cleanse data in legacy systems or staging area to prepare it for migration to the provider system in the Data Cleansing Plan
