bestPractice:
  - Review and update the IMS as necessary and maintain an integrated recurring meeting and reporting cadence
  - Include all migration activities and responsible parties in the IMS. Migrations that include core and non-core services should align all services to the IMS
  - Create a consolidated list of action items for the customer and provider
  - Utilize collaboration tools to the fullest extent in order to facilitate information sharing across the migration program
  - For large agencies and complex implementations involving segregated business processes, teams should be co-located to ensure ease of communication, collaboration and problem solving; and to maximize program integration, including network access, conferencing needs
  - Ensure provider transparency with regular reporting on expenditure to date
