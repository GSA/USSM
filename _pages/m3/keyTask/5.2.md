bestPractice:
  - Three key questions should be included in the Lessons Learned Questionnaire; (1) What went well, (2) What went wrong, and (3) What could be improved. The survey should also include questions around project activities scored on a range from low to high to allow participants to quantitatively identify what went well and what didn’t. Recommended questions categories could include project management, technology, communication, business processes, requirements, design and build, and testing and implementation 
  - When facilitating the Lessons Learned Session, the facilitator should utilize the Questionnaire findings, key project documents, and project survey results to help guide the participant conversation
  - Use the Lessons Learned Report to document the program's effectiveness by comparing the Baseline Performance and Success Metrics against the Target Performance Success Metrics and how well it aligned with the Performance Management Framework. Identify the unmet performance gaps and develop continuous improvement strategies that can help eliminate them
