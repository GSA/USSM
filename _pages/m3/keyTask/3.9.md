bestPractice:
  - Conduct system demonstrations and Conference Room Pilots to validate the solution meets the intended scope of services requirements
  - Provide training to SMEs on requirements processes and how to define, communicate, and document requirements effectively (e.g., essential, verifiable requirements)
  - Provide criteria to define mission critical versus nice-to-have requirements to enable improved provider selection
  - Use requirements management tool and establish requirements management approach that follows leading practices to increase consistency and enhance traceability throughout the program’s life cycle
  - Validate requirements against the FIBF and ensure requirements are documented to allow for effective testing
  - Use the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to align, categorize, and prioritize outcome focused requirements with applicable Service Area standard requirements based on mission need and legislation/policy. Define and reference the specific source legislation/policy document(s) for each requirement and include requirement's status (i.e. awaiting approval, approved, rejected, or deferred)
