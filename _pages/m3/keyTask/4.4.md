bestPractice:
  - Establish a standardized and common process decomposition to have consistency in terminology using guidance from the applicable Service Area
  - Perform business process alignment activities rather than traditional business process reengineering to avoid bad practices continuing in the new system
  - Identify key functional process lead and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to drive process ownership and decision making
  - Use the Target State Process Maps to document process flows and handoffs, transaction volumes, enabling technology, user roles and responsibilities, and supporting tools/documentation used to complete processes
  - Use the Standard Operating Procedures to follow agency-specific step-by-step instructions for the execution of routine operations to ensure efficiency, quality output, consistency and uniformity of performance, and compliance with relevant regulations. Organize to-be process maps into end-to-end executable steps, and specify scope, purpose, input, output, and tools and relevant regulations
