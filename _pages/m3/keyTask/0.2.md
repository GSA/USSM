bestPractice:
  - Use existing performance metric data to assist in identifying performance targets (e.g. previous Federal Benchmarking results, Customer Satisfaction Surveys, Shared Service Survey, etc.). Consider contacting <a href="mailto:ussm.m3@gsa.gov">ussm.m3@gsa.gov</a> for assistance researching agency specific and government-wide results
  - "Operational performance metrics should seek to answer more subjective questions in the specific areas of: Customer Satisfaction, Strategic and Business Results, Financial Performance, and Innovation"
  - All projects should have a business case. However, the Major IT Business Case is not required where no major IT acquisition and no capital assets are being procured 
  - Use the Investment Readiness Checklist throughout Phase 1 to verify that the correct information is included in the Project Business Case and pinpoint any missing information
