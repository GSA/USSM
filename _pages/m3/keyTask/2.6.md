  - Identify and describe the people, groups, departments, organizations, business processes, programs, and information technology (IT) systems/infrastructure that will serve as barriers to the change. Describe the ways in which these things will be a barrier to change
  - Include barriers and understand key stakeholders and how they will react to the migration in the key messages
