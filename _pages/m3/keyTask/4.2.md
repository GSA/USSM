bestPractice:
  - Maintain a risk management function within the PMO to coordinate all risk management activities across the customer and provider before migration
  - Hold regular risk management meetings and include risk management into status reporting and escalation procedures. Include documentation of risks in RAID Log in order to facilitate communication of risks
  - Maintain risk management roles and responsibilities for customer and provider team members and executives, and train team members on identifying and mitigating risks
