bestPractice:
  - Ensure proper monitoring of SLAs where both customer and provider responsibilities are clearly defined
  - Work collaboratively across the provider and customer to identify and capture the appropriate performance metrics and targets (SLAs include customer defined performance measures with associated targets inclusive of metrics to monitor customer responsiveness and quality)
  - Review Provider Agreements, SLAs, and Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCEs) for any potential updates that may be required
