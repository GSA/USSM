bestPractice:
  - Analyze early to identify which existing reports are still in use and must be included in requirements
  - Minimize customizations; use low-code/no-code and configuration approaches to simplify maintenance and upgrades
  - Use Test Plan to define testing strategy, scope, schedule, roles/stakeholders, required resources, and training approach. 
  - Establish an approach to train testers, define test items, and data requirements for testing.
