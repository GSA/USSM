bestPractice:
  - Conduct a thorough analysis early to determine which existing reports are still in use and need to be included in requirements
  - Minimize enhancements, leverage bolt-ons where possible, to help ease patch/fix application and upgrade path
  - Use the Test Plan to identify the strategies, objectives, and approach of testing cycles, involved stakeholders, needed resources, and scope and schedule of planned test activities. Develop approach to train testers and define test items and data requirements, features to be tested, testing roles and responsibilities, and any risks requiring contingency planning
