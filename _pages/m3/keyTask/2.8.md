bestPractice:
  - Conduct cost benefit analysis to determine cost of archiving, migrating legacy data, or maintaining legacy systems in place 
  - Leverage common standards and solutions defined by NARA for records management found at <a href="https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf-ERM/">https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf-ERM/ </a>
  - If system is accessed via website, coordinate domain name transition through Domain Name System (DNS) and with IT security POC
