bestPractice:
  - Assess functional, technical, and operational requirements in the Fit-Gap Analysis
  - Technical requirements for the Requirements Fit Gap Analysis should align to <a href="https://www.ussm.gov/fibf/">Data and Business standards</a>
  - Use live demonstrations for requirements fit-gap review sessions
  - Document gaps using formal gap ID forms; assess consensus. A <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/1041/2017/08/Sample-Gap-Identification-Form-1.docx">sample gap ID form</a> available for reference.
  - Develop a detailed approach for the fit-gap with a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Statement outlining Overview, Vision, Purpose and Objectives, that defines exit/success criteria.
