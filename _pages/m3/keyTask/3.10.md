bestPractice:
  - Assess functional, technical, and operational requirements as part of the Requirements Fit-Gap Analysis
  - Technical requirements for the Requirements Fit Gap Analysis should align to the <a href="https://www.ussm.gov/fibf/">FIBF standards</a>
  - Develop a detailed approach for the fit-gap with a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Statement document that includes an Overview, BPR Vision, fit-gap Purpose and Objectives, and defines exit/success criteria for the process. A sample requirements fit-gap process kick-off guide is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/1041/2017/08/Sample-Fit-Gap-Kick-off-1.pptx">here</a>
  - Use live demonstrations for requirements fit-gap review sessions
  - Document gaps using formal gap ID forms and assess consensus with feedback surveys. A sample gap ID form is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/1041/2017/08/Sample-Gap-Identification-Form-1.docx">here</a>
