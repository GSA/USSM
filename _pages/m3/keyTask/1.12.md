bestPractice:
  - Define capabilities within the customer organization before engaging a provider to communicate needs in a consistent manner 
  - Provide criteria to define mission critical versus nice-to-have capabilities to enable improved provider selection
  - Provide training to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on requirements processes and how to define, communicate, and document mission critical requirements
  - Obtain a robust requirements management tool or process to manage requirements throughout the migration, including a robust change control process
  - In Phase 1, customers should not create detailed business requirements for every service, but should instead focus on documenting must-have capabilities not in the FIBF Business Capabilities. Examples of capabilities that should be documented include; must-have mandatory system interfaces, hours of operation or availability of services, or other criteria that a provider must be able to meet in order to provide services to the customer. Customers and providers will not jointly discuss detailed technical and functional requirements until Phase 3
