bestPractice:
  - Confirm the accuracy of the organization structures based on the records maintained by first level managers and the customer Human Capital office
  - A Change Readiness Assessment involves the periodic assessment of how stakeholders are responding or engaging with the change. Note this is not a one-time assessment. If an organization’s leadership and management are driving the change in a modeled way, then they should see changes in readiness scores as the change process approaches
  - Industry standards and change management best practices provide multiple change models that can be harnessed based on preference or organizational needs (e.g., <a href="https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/change-management-methodology">Prosci</a>, <a href="https://www.prosci.com/adkar/adkar-model">Prosci’s ADKAR Change Model</a>, <a href="https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/">Kotter</a>, <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_94.htm">Lewin’s Change Model</a>) 
  - Change management’s end goal is shifting the organization from a state of resistance to acceptance. Utilize the <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_96.htm">Change Curve</a> to better understand the stages of individual transition and organizational change. Top level leadership commitment and active support for the change effort drives the most impact when implementing any change
