bestPractice:
  - Establish an ongoing and committed contact center support at each organization to help facilitate Go-Live transition
  - Have all key Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) available onsite during final pilot trial and actual deployment
  - Conduct daily meetings to monitor progress and issues for timely resolution
  - Use the Cutover Plan to define cutover communication steps and checkpoint meetings, align resources, and identify risks with aligned contingency plans in place. Determine activities for before, during, and after the day of cutover
