bestPractice:
  - Develop an integrated Risk Management Plan between the customer and provider and establish a risk management function within the PMO to coordinate all risk management activities across the customer and provider before migration 
  - Hold regular risk management meetings and include risk management into status reporting and escalation procedures. Ensure documentation of risks in RAID Log in order to facilitate communication of risks
  - Develop risk management roles and responsibilities for customer and provider team members and executives and train team members on identifying and mitigating risks
  - Train and empower risk liaisons and points of contact in risk management to improve accountability
