bestPractice:
  - Establish clear, measurable performance metrics (including compliance, process efficiency, and workload indicators) early in the program to track and communicate intended and achieved benefits
  - Benchmark Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against internal and external standards, leveraging existing data sources such as Federal Benchmarking reports and Shared Services Customer Satisfaction Surveys. For assistance, contact <a href="mailto:ussm.m3@gsa.gov">ussm.m3@gsa.gov</a>
  - Recognize that while immediate cost reductions may be limited, efficiency gains typically materialize quickly. Substantial long-term savings are often realized through strategic IT investments
