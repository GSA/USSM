bestPractice:
  - Conduct multiple mock conversions to mitigate complex conversion risks and include enough time in the IMS to correct anomalies and update conversion programs
  - Use the Data Conversion Plan to identify strategies for converting data from an existing system to a new system environment. Define system structure, hardware and software conversion steps, and type of conversion effort. Identify available data, its preparation requirements for conversion, and necessary updates to available interfaces. Establish data quality assurance controls for before and after data conversion, and define tasks, procedures, and necessary support for carrying out conversion efforts
  - Use the Mock Conversion Report to define data required for conversion, understand the percent of data successfully converted, and develop a data conversion issue list to track resolved and outstanding items. Evaluate data conversion against success criteria to determine readiness for cutover and develop history of prior data conversion runs
