bestPractice:
  - Set defined performance and success metrics (including baselines and targets) at the beginning of the program to be able to measure and communicate the benefits intended and ultimately achieved
  - Measure performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) set in Phase 1, internal and external standards including <a href="http://www.benchmarks.gsa.gov/">benchmarks.gsa.gov</a>, and the <a href="https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf/">Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF)</a> Performance Management Framework
  - Correctly set expectations of performance noting that while savings often are realized from shared support arrangements, the efficiencies do not appear immediately and in the short-run may appear to be more costly during the stabilization period
