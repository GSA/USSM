bestPractice:
  - Define Go/No-Go Assessment Criteria upfront and define measurable criteria to make decisions
  - Use the Contingency Plan to account for all decision scenarios resulting from the Go/No-Go assessment (e.g., No-Go Decision, Roll-Back Decision). For each scenario, this includes completed plans for required communications and activities, detailed analysis of impacted systems and interfaces, and defined roles and responsibilities for re-planning activities and managing legacy systems
