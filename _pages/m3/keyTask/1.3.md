bestPractice:
  - Develop internal governance model at the beginning of the migration to make decisions in alignment with the objectives and goals of the program
  - Obtain buy-in from internal organizations early on to establish collaboration throughout the migration; obtain buy-in from executives, managers, and line personnel as stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
  - Encourage decisions to be made at the lowest possible level, while allowing elevation of important or contentious issues through the governance model
  - Incorporate a variety of stakeholders, including the governance and transition team, in the development of the agency vision
  - Ensure that leadership within the governance structure is able to make all necessary decisions with regard to financing and direction
  - Assign a QSMO Liaison as a designated point of contact to increase efficiency
