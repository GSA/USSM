bestPractice:
  - Understand which processes should be retained versus migrated
  - Understand which processes will have to change due to the migration to a shared environment
  - Document the process taxonomy to determine what will stay, what will go, and what will be migrated 
  - Define all target systems/services, including expected performance requirements (e.g., estimated services/transaction volumes), performance metrics (i.e. based on the <a href="https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf/">Federal Integrated Business Framework</a>), and prioritized target systems/services for implementation developing prioritization basis for the scope of services for O&M and Migration
