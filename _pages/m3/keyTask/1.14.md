bestPractice:
  - Identify personnel with critical skill sets and align them with specific program activities; bring on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and information technology (IT) personnel early to ensure a successful migration in later phases
  - Define people, budget, and contracts before beginning implementation activities; align activities to specific resources in the Initial Master Schedule
  - Map the agency system development life cycle (SDLC), if existent, to the M3 framework to identify appropriate agency documentation and templates that can be adapted to the M3 framework in order  to minimize re-work
  - When developing an Acquisition Strategy, align all program acquisitions with the Resource Management Plan, define scope and period of performance for each contract, integrate Contracting Officerâ€™s Representative (COR), and define types of contracts and acquisition methods for all planned program acquisitions
  - Follow FAR and any internal agency processes (e.g. FAR 7.105, Acquisition Strategy, written plans)
