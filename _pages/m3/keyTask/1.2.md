bestPractice:
  - Establish the necessary PMO structure, staff and processes upfront as it will set the stage for the remainder of the migration
  - Maintain the same key personnel throughout the program
  - Develop Program Charter with a defined scope upfront based on the agreed upon vision; the Initial Master Schedule should be flexible and closely monitored for necessary updates
  - Align program resources in the Initial Master Schedule to the Resource Management Plan and Acquisition Strategy. Develop work breakdown structure (WBS), critical path, schedule management process, and identify dependencies 
  - Agencies purchasing transaction processing services only should use the M3 Services Tailoring Guide to identify M3 activities and outputs relevant to their project
  - Develop IV&V Plan to independently and proactively identify risks, define reporting structure, integrate governance processes, and establish procedures to incorporate findings
  - Clearly articulate goals and objectives that capture the “why” of the change and a high level statement of future activities
