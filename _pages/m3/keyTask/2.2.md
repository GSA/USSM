bestPractice:
  - Conduct life cycle cost analyses and incorporate initial migration cost estimates from the provider in order to plan out-year budget needs and requests
  - Be realistic about when cost savings will be realized by tracking cost and efficiencies achieved during the full implementation of the vision through to the decommissioning of the legacy system
  - Include direct and indirect costs in estimates
