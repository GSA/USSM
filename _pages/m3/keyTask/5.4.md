bestPractice:
  - Develop and execute frequent and multi-directional communications to increase the likelihood that most stakeholders receive the messages
  - Maintain job-aids, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and other documentation and ensure they are readily available for employees to refresh after migration 
  - Use the O&M sections within the Change Management, Communications, and Training Plans to capture what the expected changes are and how best to manage them
  - Encourage exploration by those impacted by changes and address perceived resistance to improve the change adoption. Reinforce change in the transition by using communication and training to gather customer and staff feedback during the process
  - Continue to seek feedback from all stakeholder groups to better ensure a successful change process
