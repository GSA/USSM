bestPractice:
  - Prepare multi-year budget projections using LCCE aligned w/planned scope and operational impacts
  - Detail LCCE at the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level, differentiating recurring (e.g., operations and maintenance) and non-recurring (e.g., implementation) costs
  - Ensure alignment of LCCE with investment documents (such as E300) and secure Executive Sponsor approval
  - LCCE examples are available on the <a href="https://community.max.gov/display/GSA/M3+Artifact+Samples">M3 Example MAX Page</a>
