bestPractice:
  - Plan multi-year budget requests through life cycle cost analyses based on expected scope and operational impacts of releases 
  - Provide LCCE at the work breakdown structure (WBS) product or activity level, breakout costs as recurring/non-recurring (e.g., migration and Operations and Maintenance costs), align budget estimates and other required investment documentation (e.g., E300) to the LCCE, and receive final approval from the Executive Sponsor
  - LCCE examples are available on the M3 Example MAX Page
