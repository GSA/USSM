bestPractice:
  - Begin data cleansing activities prior to migration activities and continuously throughout the implementation to assist with data readiness
  - Agree on data governance including metadata management and data quality management
  - Incorporate additional post Go-Live data cleansing and quality activities into the Data Conversion Plan strategy, schedule, and resource planning
  - Investigate provider service offerings around post Go-Live conversion support prior to finalizing cleansing metrics
  - Develop procedures, tools, and protocols to extract data and define system structure, major components, and type of conversion effort. Define system hardware and software conversion steps, identify necessary data and preparation requirements, and establish data quality assurance controls for conversion. Identify and address affected interfaces and security issues related to conversion efforts
