bestPractice:
  - Start data cleansing early and prior to implementation; continue throughout to ensure readiness
  - Agree on data governance, including metadata and data quality management
  - Include post–Go-Live cleansing and quality tasks in data conversion strategy, schedule, and resourcing
  - Review provider post–Go-Live support services before finalizing cleansing metrics
  - Develop extraction procedures, tools, and protocols. Define system structure, major components, and type of conversion effort.
  - Identify and address affected interfaces and security issues related to conversion efforts.
  - Define hardware / software conversion steps, identify data and pre-conversion requirements, establish data quality assurance controls for conversion.
