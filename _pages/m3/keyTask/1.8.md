bestPractice:
  - The Stakeholder Analysis is necessary to strategically and proactively communicate and involve stakeholders in change management activities, which will improve stakeholder engagement, reduce risk, and remove barriers to migration
  - Incorporate change management strategies and approaches, as applicable, directly into communications planning (e.g., targeted email campaigns, leadership brown bags)
  - Include Communications Lead early in the process and consider Communications Leadâ€™s roles throughout the entire process
  - Provide frequent, early, and as close to real-time audience targeted communication updates throughout the process. Communications may need to account for a union presence, reach out internally within the agency to determine appropriate handlings
  - Communicate the value and benefits of migration and business process changes to the larger workforce after the business case and throughout the implementation
