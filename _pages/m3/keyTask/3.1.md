bestPractice:
  - To maximize program integration, including network access, and conferencing needs for large agencies and for complex implementations involving segregated business processes, teams should be co-located to ensure ease of communication, collaboration, and problem solving
  - Hold detailed discussions on the customer’s and provider’s goals, processes that will be migrated, systems, and program close-out roles and responsibilities early on
  - Develop an integrated Program Management Plan that is a coordinated view of activities from the customer and provider and takes specific customer needs into consideration
  - Staff and engage both customer and provider PMO teams in the governance process to prevent governance gaps and disruptions to the flow of information
  - Establish and communicate customer and provider roles and responsibilities through written agreements
  - Establish and confirm common nomenclature between the provider and customer organizations to ensure clear and concise communication throughout Phases 3 and 4 
  - Use Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to document Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) commitment and maintain accountability for participating in Fit-Gap sessions
  - Ensure provider transparency with regular reporting on expenditure to date
