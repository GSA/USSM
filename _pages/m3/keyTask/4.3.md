  - Encourage decisions to be made at the lowest possible level, while allowing elevation of important or contentious issues through the governance model
  - Review Provider Agreements, SLAs, and Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCEs) for any potential updates that may be required
  - Use the O&M Governance Plan to develop an integrated governance body of providers and customers with defined roles and responsibilities. Establish voting rights and escalation criteria accounting for all O&M activities. Outline voting procedures and determine governance meeting cadence and communications
