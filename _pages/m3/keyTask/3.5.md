bestPractice:
  - Clearly communicate customer agency / provider roles before implementation using agreements, org charts, and RACI matrix 
  - Understand service scope, SLAs, and cost structures in the agreements
  - Set metrics to track shared performance responsibilities
  - Apply an agile approach and consider phased implementation to achieve quick wins
  - Use Provider Agreement to outline Provider / Customer Agency roles, decision rights, key activities, and reporting
  - Build work breakdown structure (WBS) in the IMS to capture implementation scope; align schedule and critical path with resource planning and acquisition strategy
