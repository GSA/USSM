bestPractice:
  - Define, agree on, and communicate customer and provider roles and responsibilities prior to the start of implementation through the Provider Agreement and implementation team organization charts and Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) Matrix 
  - Understand the Provider Agreement services, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and cost structures and develop relevant metrics to be able to monitor provider performance
  - Leverage an agile approach in the migration and consider phasing the implementation to provide for quick wins
  - Use Provider Agreement to define the roles and responsibilities of the customer, provider, and governance bodies during migration, including decision rights, key activities and reporting procedures
  - Use the IMS to develop the work breakdown structure (WBS) that includes full scope of work for both the customer and provider through the migration. Develop the critical path and align the schedule management process with identified program resources to the Resources Management Plan and Acquisition Strategy
