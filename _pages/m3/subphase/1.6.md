bestPractice:
  - Set defined performance and success metrics (including baselines and targets) at the beginning of the program to be able to measure and communicate the benefits intended, and ultimately achieved, by the program Benchmark Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against internal and external standards
  - Benchmark Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against internal and external standards and use existing performance metric data to assist in identifying performance targets (i.e. previous Federal Benchmarking results, Customer Satisfaction Surveys, etc.). Consider contacting ussm.m3@gsa.gov for assistance researching agency specific and government-wide results
  - In most cases greater efficiencies are achieved, but short-term cost reductions are not. With the introduction of greater amounts of IT support however, substantial savings are realized in the longer term
