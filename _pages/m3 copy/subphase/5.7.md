bestPractice:
  - Set defined performance and success metrics (including baselines and targets) at the beginning of the program to be able to measure and communicate the benefits intended and ultimately achieved
  - Measure performance against KPIs set in Phase 1 and internal and external standards, including benchmarks.gsa.gov
  - Correctly set expectations of performance noting that while savings often are realized from shared support arrangements, the efficiencies do not appear immediately and in the short-run may appear to be more costly during the stabilization period
