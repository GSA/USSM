          1. What are shared services?
        </button>
      </h4>
      <div id="faq1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p>Shared services refers to the delivery of common mission-support services through consolidated, standardized, and scalable capabilities available in a marketplace of both commercial and federal providers. Agencies are operating under OMB Memorandum M-19-16, <em>Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government</em>.</p>

          2. What are the benefits of shared services?
        </button>
      </h4>
      <div id="faq2" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p>Shared services is an industry best practice growing in popularity across the private sector that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the federal government. In its July 2023 paper on “Measuring the Business Value of Shared Services,” the Shared Services Leadership Coalition reported that 60% of large private organizations have transitioned to an organization-wide shared services approach. Many state governments, nonprofits, and businesses have been able to reduce costs and improve their operational effectiveness by adopting shared services.</p>
        <p>Shared services are designed to increase government efficiency, address redundancies, improve service quality, reduce operating costs, and drive better use of technology across the federal government. The federal government can achieve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reduced Operating Costs</strong> – Shared services help agencies achieve economies of scale that lead to reduced operating costs and greater value per taxpayer dollar spent.</li>
          <li><strong>Adoption of Modern Technology</strong> – Modernizing technology with best-in-class commercial solutions cuts the complexity, maintenance costs, and risk of legacy systems, and improves access to emerging capabilities such as Artificial Intelligence and robotic process automation that enhance the efficiency of federal programs and the public they serve.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Management</strong> – Shared services enable better management by offering technology, support, and data needed to prioritize outcomes and reduce duplication to focus resources on customer experience and mission delivery.</li>
          <li><strong>Smarter Buying</strong> – Fully leveraging the buying power, data, and market research benefit of best-in-class contracts reduces procurement overhead, increases innovation, and drives opportunities to high-performing providers based on merit.</li>
          <li><strong>Moving to Higher Value Work</strong> – An enterprise approach to servicing agency mission support functions better aligns people to mission and enables the personnel shift to higher value work across the government.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Change is difficult. Achieving the benefits of shared services is a long-term effort that challenges leaders to rethink their decision-making.</p>

          3. How does this shared services initiative differ from previous iterations?
        </button>
      </h4>
      <div id="faq3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leveraging Lessons Learned</strong> – This strategy is informed by the successes and lessons learned from previous initiatives and identifies a long-term vision that will deliver better value and outcomes for American taxpayers.</li>
          <li><strong>Following the Lead of Successful Existing Services</strong> – There are great examples of how shared services work in government today – such as GSA’s management of agencies’ vehicle fleet. This results in a savings of $0.23 cents per mile driven compared to when agencies manage their own fleets.</li>
          <li>We are using a well-researched, data-driven approach to identify common standards that align to commercial best practices. The underpinning of this entire effort is ensuring we follow standards to help determine where sharing opportunities make sense and where they do not, driving economies of scale and leveraging the government’s buying power.</li>
          <li>This effort moves away from a “one size fits all” model and creates long-term options for agencies based on their maturity and readiness, allowing them to partner with Quality Service Management Offices (QSMOs) for technology, services, or both.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
        <button type="button" class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4">
          4. How are the QSMOs different than the current federal providers?
        </button>
      </h4>
      <div id="faq4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Marketplace Brokers</strong> – QSMOs themselves are not shared service providers. Each QSMO operates a marketplace of pre-vetted commercial and federal solutions for their specific functional area. These solutions address common agency needs and are based on government-wide standards defined in the Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF). QSMOs are located within parent organizations aligned with the QSMO’s functional area for long-term stability.</li>
          <li>Besides managing shared service marketplaces, QSMOs work with current federal shared service providers on modernization plans and funding for technology modernization. They coordinate with providers to determine how and when to migrate to QSMO marketplace solutions (via a Joint Business Case), requiring approval from agency Deputy Secretaries (in collaboration with SAPOCs) and final OMB approval.</li>
          <li>All agencies requiring new investments to modernize or enhance software or services in a pre-designated or designated QSMO area must engage with that QSMO to discuss goals, needs, and timelines. QSMO offerings leverage government-wide standards in the FIBF.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
        <button type="button" class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq5">
          5. How do you ensure offerings meet agency needs and federal requirements?
        </button>
      </h4>
      <div id="faq5" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <ul>
          <li>Lead agencies work on creating standards for each functional area with their cross-agency community, ensuring every agency can contribute requirements that are documented in the FIBF.</li>
          <li>Once the majority of standards are agreed upon by the cross-agency community, it may be a candidate for sharing. Any regulatory or legislative differences for an agency are addressed outside of the standards process.</li>
          <li>In FY24, OSSPI developed a performance management framework for providers in the marketplaces, covering six dimensions: Customer, Financial, Standards Adoption, Provider Operations, Technology, and Organizational. This framework, created with QSMOs and OMB, is based on outreach, research, and best practices.</li>
          <li>The Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB) monitors how marketplace offerings align to performance management standards and recommends corrective actions as needed.</li>
          <li>OSSPI conducts an Annual Shared Services Customer Satisfaction Survey to measure whether provider offerings meet agency needs and to identify additional service needs.</li>
        </ul>

      </h4>
      <div id="faq6" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <ul>
          <li>Agencies have long participated in building the standards that form the backbone of this strategy through standards working groups and the Business Standards Council (BSC).</li>
          <li>Customer perspectives are represented by the Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB) and agency Senior Accountable Points of Contact (SAPOCs). These groups provide direction, maintain long-term support, and ensure shared services are effectively implemented across agency management functions.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Systems and solutions in QSMO marketplaces are based on standards in the FIBF.</li>

        <p>The QSMOs are centralized locations for services and solutions within designated functional areas. Agencies should engage with QSMOs to discuss goals, needs, and timelines. Any deviation from QSMO services requires QSMO and OMB agreement.</p>

      <div id="faq9" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p><strong>Government’s Role</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>QSMOs drive government-wide standardization, manage contracted solutions, coordinate unique federal requirements, and handle solution integration through common interfaces.</li>
          <li>QSMOs build marketplaces in accordance with the FAR (Sections 10-12) to encourage commercial solutions before exclusive government development.</li>
          <li>OMB, GSA’s OSSPI, the SSGB, SAPOCs, and the President’s Management Council (PMC) guide the future vision, hold QSMOs accountable, ensure the customer voice is heard, and address risks.</li>
