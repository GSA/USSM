            <li>Shared Services is an industry best practice and model that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal Government.
              <ol type="I">
                <li>State governments, nonprofits and businesses (including more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies) have improved effectiveness, increased capabilities, and reduced costs by adopting a shared services model.</li>
                <li>Standardizing capabilities, data, business processes and technology needed to streamline common administrative and business functions, leaders in these fields have found the greatest gains in efficiency.</li>
                <li>Reducing agency administrative burden–such as with processing financial and human resource transactions, accelerating high quality acquisitions, enabling travel–and securing the Federal enterprise through high-performing Shared Services enables agencies to devote more resources to strategic planning and most critical mission activities.</li>
                <li>Shared Services enable evidence-based decision making through access to reliable, standardized and just-in-time data for better management.</li>
                <li>Agencies with a common mission focus (e.g., Health, Law Enforcement, Regulatory) can benefit from their similarities in leveraging a shared solution rather than continuing non-value added uniquenesses.</li>
                <li>Shared Services can help agencies attain economies of scale through consolidating and modernizing technologies across the government.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Government-wide Shared Services initiative is designed to increase government efficiency, not eliminate jobs.
              <ol type="I">
                <li>Meeting agencies’ shared needs to support mission delivery through a marketplace of commercial and Federal services can help agencies save time and money, avail agencies of modern tools, and create a more nimble workforce focused on higher value work.</li>
                <li>The knowledge and expertise of Federal employees will be critical to its success. It is important the Federal Government retains that expertise, even if specific day-to-day activities evolve.</li>
                <li>As duplicated functions are consolidated over time, agencies have many tools available to help optimize, reskill and shift resources to higher value work.</li>
                <li>By focusing more time and effort on the core functions that fundamentally make one agency different from another, we are able to further develop deeper levels of expertise.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Shared Services can bridge the current disconnect between the costly investment in administrative services and low satisfaction rates among Federal leaders.
              <ol type="I">
                <li>As stewards of taxpayer dollars, we owe it to the American people to spend them wisely. Each year the Federal Government spends billions on administrative services, but 38 percent of Federal leaders report low satisfaction with mission support services.</li>
                <li>Leveraging Shared Services will allow agencies to introduce innovations like robotics, data analytics, automation and continual improvement that drive further efficiencies and performance gains, while freeing up our workforce to focus on achieving their most critical missions.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Change is difficult and we are just getting started. Achieving the benefits of shared services is a long-term effort that will challenge leaders to rethink their decision making.</li>

            <li>Lead agencies have been identified in each functional area, in partnership with their cross-agency community, to ensure every agency has the opportunity to contribute their own requirements to the enterprise-wide effort.</li>
            <li>Once the majority of the standards are agreed upon by the cross-agency community, it may be considered a good candidate for sharing. If there are regulatory or legislative reasons for something to be different for an agency, that will be addressed outside of the standards process.</li>
            <li>There is also a set of QSMO criteria, informed by industry best practices and many years of lessons learned, to guide the QSMO agencies as they stand up new service offerings. The role of the Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB) is to validate that those offerings align to the criteria and to help propose corrective actions when necessary.</li>
            <li>The governance board membership consists of two representatives from each Federal CXO management council, or the “voice of the customer.”</li>
            <li>QSMOs will institute a customer engagement and feedback model that allows for continuous improvement and performance management of solutions.</li>

            <li>Agencies are also directed through policy and budget guidance to buy from a QSMO Marketplace in designated and pre-designated areas.
