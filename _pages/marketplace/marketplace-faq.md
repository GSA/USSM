  <div class="section-title">About the Grants QSMO</div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What is the Grants QSMO and how is it different from other grant offices?</button>
    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>The Grants QSMO, designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), helps federal agencies manage and invest in grants technology. Unlike offices that award and manage grants, it focuses on validating and supporting shared IT solutions to streamline grants management, reduce duplication, and enhance efficiency across the government.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">Does the QSMO serve only HHS or all federal agencies?</button>
    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>Although part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Grants QSMO serves all federal agencies. Any federal agency looking to modernize its grants IT and align with broader goals can access QSMO resources, including the Marketplace of validated solutions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">How does the QSMO support federal priorities like the GREAT Act?</button>
    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>The Grants QSMO helps implement the Grants Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act of 2019 (Pub. L. No. 116—103) by validating solutions that align with government-wide data standards. It collaborates with the Grants Data Standards Lead and contributes to federal efforts to ensure consistent, transparent, and interoperable data across agencies.</p>

  <div class="section-title">Marketplace Management</div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">What types of solutions are available?</button>
    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>The Marketplace offers a variety of federal shared services and commercial solutions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software platforms and resources for managing the grants lifecycle</li>
        <li>Modular services for intake, workflow, monitoring, and reporting</li>
        <li>Full lifecycle systems designed for pre-award, award, post-award, and closeout phases</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">How should agencies use the Marketplace?</button>
    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>Agencies should use the Marketplace as a starting point for grants IT investments. It helps identify validated, federally aligned solutions while minimizing the risk of duplicative development. Agencies are encouraged to work with the Grants QSMO for tailored guidance and to explore investment planning resources.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">

    <div class="faq-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="true">
      <p>If the available Marketplace options don’t fit an agency’s unique needs, the Grants QSMO encourages direct engagement to explore all possible solutions. In the unlikely event that there are no suitable options found, agencies may initiate an Investment Action Plan (IAP) to consider alternative investments while ensuring alignment with government-wide standards.</p>
