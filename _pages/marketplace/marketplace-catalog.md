          If the solutions in the Grants QSMO Marketplace Catalog do not meet
          your agency's needs, visit the <a href="#">Resources</a> tab for
          guidance on creating an Investment Action Plan (IAP). However, keep in
          mind that developing an IAP should only be a last resort and avoided
          whenever feasible.
