Per <A HREF="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf">OMB Memo 19-16, <I>Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government</I></A>, all CFO Act Agencies will designate a Senior Accountable Point of Contact (SAPOC) to coordinate across agency mission support functions and collaborate with program offices to support adoption of the shared service strategies, communicate information across the agency, and take other related actions to drive operational efficiency and effectiveness consistent with the goals of the Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda (PMA), as outlined on Performance.gov. Lastly, a list of the Senior Management Officials is also provided.  The Senior Management Official is typically, though not always, the most senior official over an agency's management and administrative functions.
