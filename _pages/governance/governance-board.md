The Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB) is a cross-council Board of agency executives from each of the Federal Executive Councils. The Board serves as the agency voice in making recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on opportunities to identify the shared tools, technologies, and services needed to advance agency management priorities and advise on their implementation. The SSGB also serves as an escalation point for the Business Standards Council to resolve cross-functional inconsistencies in the creation of data and business standards and to propose resolutions for consideration by OMB policy officials. Membership includes executives from across the Federal enterprise to provide a broad perspective on opportunities, concerns, and policies related to agency adoption and use of these services and technologies.
