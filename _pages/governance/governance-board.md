The Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB) is a cross-council Board of agency executives from each of the Federal Executive Councils. The Board serves as the agency voice in making recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on opportunities to identify shared agency needs for technologies and services that will advance management priorities and set direction for their implementation. The SSGB also serves as an escalation point for the Business Standards Council to resolve cross-functional inconsistencies in the creation of data and business standards and to determine the path forward needed to support OMB policy officials. Members include executives from across the Federal enterprise to provide cross-cutting perspectives on decisions related to the opportunities, concerns, and policies affecting agency adoption and use.  The SSGB was formed in 2015 and its most recent charter <A HREF="/assets/files/SSGB-Charter-August2024.pdf">can be found here</A>.

<FONT COLOR=0000dd>Notice (January 23, 2026): The SSGB is undergoing a reset and reconstitution.  More information about its members and work to advance the administration's consolidation, de-duplication, and standardization priorities is forthcoming.</FONT>
