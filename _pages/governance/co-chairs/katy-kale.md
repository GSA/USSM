Katy Kale is the Deputy Administrator of the General Services Administration under the Biden-Harris Administration.
In this capacity, she leads a staff of about 12,000 GSA employees nationwide, overseeing more than 370 million square feet of property, approximately $75 billion in annual contracts, 5 million government credit and purchase cards, and 225,000 leased vehicles. She also serves as GSA’s Senior Climate Adaptation Official. In addition, she is the Vice Chair of the U.S. Access Board, which promotes accessible design, guidelines, and standards.

Prior to serving as the Deputy Administrator, and as Acting Administrator in early 2021, Katy was President and Chief Operating Officer of Elevate, a small woman-owned business that helps nonprofits create and strengthen their grant programs. There she led growth strategy, operational process, financial planning, and performance management, and ensured all were aligned with the broader purpose of serving the nonprofit sector.

A public servant at heart, Katy was a senior leader in the Obama-Biden Administration, serving in White House roles including Assistant to the President for Management and Administration and Director of White House Operations from 2009–2015. From 2015 to 2017, she was Chief of Staff at GSA. Previously, she served 10 years in the U.S. Senate working on operational and legislative issues for several senators, including Senators Chuck Robb, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, and Sherrod Brown.

Katy earned a bachelor’s degree in government and international politics from George Mason University.
