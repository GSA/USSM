USAID's Chief Information Officer Jason Gray has over two decades of leadership in management, operations, and handling of large information technology (IT) portfolios for both civil service and private sector organizations. Jason’s career began at Lockheed Martin, where he worked as a Systems Engineer and Analyst, and later in a management role for over a decade. He has also spent time in the healthcare field, as CIO of the Miami VA Healthcare System and as Chief Technology Officer of the National Naval Medical Center. Here, he became familiar with providing IT solutions that better serve those in public service and in the federal government. These were skills which he later applied in his role as the Associate CIO at the Department of Transportation (DOT) where he managed DOT’s $3.5 billion IT portfolio, in addition to providing executive leadership on IT policy and oversight for information governance, compliance, and departmental policy.

Most recently, he has served as the CIO for the Department of Education (ED), where he provided strategic, tactical and operational technology leadership in overseeing the coordination, management and delivery of mission-critical core Information Technology (IT) services to 24K+ employees across the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Jason was responsible for providing a secure, protected, and safeguarded environment for ED’s loan portfolio worth over $1 Trillion. 

Under Jason’s steadfast leadership, the DOE reshaped its approach to cybersecurity and moved from on-premise data centers to the cloud. Most notably, Jason’s management of the DOE’s extensive IT portfolios aided in a collaboration with the Technology Modernization Fund Board which resulted in an additional $20 million to assist with the adoption of zero trust architecture. This venture aided over 100 million students and borrowers, protecting and supporting their data.

Jason received his M.B.A. from Colorado Technical University, completed the Key Executive Leadership Certificate at American University, and holds a variety of technical and professional certifications, including the Project Management Professional (PMP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certifications.
