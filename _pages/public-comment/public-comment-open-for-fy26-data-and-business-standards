        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p><b>What are the data and business standards?</b></p>
        <p>Data and Business standards, established and agreed to by agencies, using the Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) enable the government to better coordinate on the decision-making needed to determine the types of services and technologies that can be adopted and commonly shared. They are an essential first step towards agreement on outcomes, data, and cross-functional end to end processes that will drive economies of scale and leverage the government’s buying power.</p>
        <p><b>How are the data and business standards used?</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Translate Policy into Practice:</b> They enable Federal agencies and their  industry partners to coordinate and document business needs based on authoritative policy across agencies, focusing on outcomes, capabilities, and data.</li>
            <li><b>Procurement:</b> Agencies can use the data and business standards as a starting point for the business requirements needed to engage with industry and Federal providers on the procurement of mission support technologies and services including cloud and software as a service based technologies where available.
            </li>
            <li><b>Agency Investment Review:</b> The business standards support the investment planning needed to align a funding vision for modernization by enabling an agency to evaluate its modernization options against an agreed to taxonomy that represents the business lifecycle of its management functions.</li>
            <li><b>Assess Readiness for Service Adoption:</b> They support the strategic planning to improve mission support services by giving decision makers the data needed to identify future opportunity areas for shared services. This includes identifying opportunities for modernization based on common themes, and policy reform based on agency feedback.</li>
            <li>
            <b>Agreement Across Mission Support Functions:</b> The business standards help obtain government-wide consensus on what business processes belong in each mission support functions to establish a shared understanding of the scope of services and coordination needed across shared services.
