        <p><b>What are the data and business standards?</b></p>
        <p>Data and Business standards, established and agreed to by agencies, using the Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) enable the government to better coordinate on the decision-making needed to determine the types of services and technologies that can be adopted and commonly shared. They are an essential first step towards agreement on outcomes, data, and cross-functional end to end processes that will drive economies of scale and leverage the government’s buying power.</p>
        <p><b>How are the data and business standards used?</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Translate Policy into Practice:</b> They enable Federal agencies and their  industry partners to coordinate and document business needs based on authoritative policy across agencies, focusing on outcomes, capabilities, and data.</li>
            <li><b>Procurement:</b> Agencies can use the data and business standards as a starting point for the business requirements needed to engage with industry and Federal providers on the procurement of mission support technologies and services including cloud and software as a service based technologies where available.
            </li>
            <li><b>Agency Investment Review:</b> The business standards support the investment planning needed to align a funding vision for modernization by enabling an agency to evaluate its modernization options against an agreed to taxonomy that represents the business lifecycle of its management functions.</li>
            <li><b>Assess Readiness for Service Adoption:</b> They support the strategic planning to improve mission support services by giving decision makers the data needed to identify future opportunity areas for shared services.
