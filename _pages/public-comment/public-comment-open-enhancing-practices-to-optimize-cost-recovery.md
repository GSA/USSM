            Public Comment: Enhancing Practices to Optimize Cost Recovery (Final Draft)
        </h1>
        <p><b>August 21, 2024</b></p>
        <p>GSA's Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) worked with Shared Services Providers (SSP) and Agency Customers to establish community viewpoints and best practices recommendations as a next step in supporting rate setting and cost recovery in the shared services ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s a goal that these practices and viewpoints will lead to improved outcomes in facilitating discussions between Providers and Agency Customers to establish suitable frameworks for cost recovery that meet the needs of sufficiently recovering full costs for both operations and periodic technology refreshes and modernizations.</p>
        <p>The draft document, Enhancing Practices to Optimize Cost Recovery, which compiles best practices and community viewpoints for Shared Services Providers (SSPs) and Customer Agencies to consider in their discussions both with one other and their home agencies in areas of rate setting, the budget and appropriations lifecycle, and provider / customer engagement is available for public comment through October 1, 2024:</p>
