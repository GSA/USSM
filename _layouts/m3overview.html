  The M3 Framework is a six-phased approach to system and service modernizations and migrations including key activities and outcomes for each phase. Within each phase there are associated activities that are detailed in the M3 Playbook.

<div style="font-family: calibri; font-size: 16px; font-weight: strong; color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Below is an overview of the activities that occur within each phase. The activities are broken into four work streams that are common to modernization and migration programs/projects: (1) Program Management; (2) Workforce, Organization and Stakeholders; (3) Technology; and, (4) Process and Service Delivery. Many of the activities/outcomes identified in these work streams are updated through progressive iterations across the phases. The overview emphasizes the need to address the non-technical aspects of the modernization or migration early in the process to ensure organizational and operational success.</span>
